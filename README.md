# AuroraClient
Aurora is a client for Minecraft 1.12.2 based on Havook by Crimz8n.

### Notice
Aurora client is now officially dead. Though we can all agree this was kinda trash.
I've moved on to other things. But if you want to know what client I'll be using here it is:

https://meteorclient.com

### If anyone ANYONE has a better clickgui I can use let me know in issues.



### Source Code
The source code of the client is available in this repo and in each release.
